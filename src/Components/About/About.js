        <p>
          My name is Felicie Amundaray, I’m 27 Years old, I’m a System Engineer since 2018 graduated from Universidad Bicentenaria de Aragua.   I could describe my three best skills as proactive, organized, and be nerdy (I always keep myself learning).   I consider myself a versatile person who can adapt to the situation I can work well on my own or either as a member of a team it's never stopped me to do a good job.

          My beginnings in software development are in high school, back then in 2008 I learned by self-training to make simple HTML pages and something of PHP.   At college, I made almost all my projects with Java but the first official programing language I can say was Pascal   While I was universitarian I had my first employment in a familiar company there I played a Sub Manager role and I was in charge of countability and technological side of the company, the technology department was conformed by networking, security systems, hardware and software maintenance, and management.   In 2017 I made my professional practices at the direction of health for the Capital District and my internship project was about designing a centralized web application for manage medical supplies inventory applying PHP and MySQL.

          When I got my diploma, I started to work formally in an outsourcing company called AMAGI there my role was as a developer full-stack but my official position was as Developer Level 1, where I worked with several technologies like PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL.   At this point, I never worked with any framework or anything before so I got my first experience and learn how to work with them and a couple of tools more to develop faster and better, some of them are Codeigniter, Laravel, WordPress, Bootstrap, among others.   Meanwhile, I worked in the AMAGI Software department I collaborated on different projects; one of them was about an e-learning startup, that one focused on consulting and make connections between clients and consultors, all that in a single platform, another project was related to helping people to do and receive donations for medical supplies, medicines or others medicals stuff like crutches or prosthesis; another job that I did there was manage an existing system developed in a custom version of Delphi where sometimes I had to process requirements directly from a MySQL database.

          After that job, I started to do freelancing on my own until I found another enterprise that employed me as an independent freelancer, they do the work to find and select possibles projects and clients.   Was by doing freelance since 2019 when I started to work with a bigger technology portfolio I got expanded by working a lot more with JavaScript in differents environments thanks to NodeJS, learning other languages like Python, and adding new tools and knowledge React, Angular, Ionic, Django, Flask, Docker, PostgreSQL, MongoDB y Android native.   As a freelancer, I have been collaborating on several projects: Changing some functions on an existing taxi app developed with Ionic, A Django app for a refugee, and a project for a parcel company.
